我们嘴里说着同样的话，内心想着各自的事情。


    "No. One can be insensible to cold as to every other pain. Marcus Aurelius says: 'A pain is a vivid idea of pain; make an effort of will to change that idea, dismiss it, cease to complain, and the pain will disappear.' That is true. The wise man, or simply the reflecting, thoughtful man, is distinguished precisely by his contempt for suffering; he is always contented and surprised at nothing."

“不，一个人对寒冷可以像对其他的痛苦一样的无动于衷。Marcus Aurelius说：‘痛苦其实是一个生动的对痛苦的想法，努力用意志来改变那个想法，摒弃它，停止抱怨，然后痛苦就会消失。’这是真的。这个有智慧的人，或者说只要是会反思的，有思想的人，与众不同之处就在于他们对痛苦的不屑一顾，他们一直都是满足的，不会对任何事情感到惊讶。”

    "Then I am an idiot, since I suffer and am discontented and surprised at the baseness of mankind."

”那我就是一个白痴了。因为我痛苦，不满足，惊讶于人类的卑鄙。”

    "You are wrong in that; if you will reflect more on the subject you will understand how insignificant is all that external world that agitates us. One must strive for the comprehension of life, and in that is true happiness."

“你错了。如果你在这件事上更多地反思你会了解到所有那些外界世界激怒我们的东西是多么地微不足道。一个人一定要追求对生活的理解，在那其中就是真正的幸福。”

    "Comprehension . . ." repeated Ivan Dmitritch frowning. "External, internal. . . . Excuse me, but I don t understand it. I only know," he said, getting up and looking angrily at the doctor--"I only know that God has created me of warm blood and nerves, yes, indeed! If organic tissue is capable of life it must react to every stimulus. And I do! To pain I respond with tears and outcries, to baseness with indignation, to filth with loathing. To my mind, that is just what is called life. The lower the organism, the less sensitive it is, and the more feebly it reacts to stimulus; and the higher it is, the more responsively and vigorously it reacts to reality. How is it you don't know that? A doctor, and not know such trifles! To despise suffering, to be always contented, and to be surprised at nothing, one must reach this condition"--and Ivan Dmitritch pointed to the peasant who was a mass of fat--"or to harden oneself by suffering to such a point that one loses all sensibility to it-- that is, in other words, to cease to live. You must excuse me, I am not a sage or a philosopher," Ivan Dmitritch continued with irritation, "and I don't understand anything about it. I am not capable of reasoning.”

“理解……”Ivan Dmitritch皱着眉重复，“外界，内在……抱歉，但是我不明白。我只知道，“他说着，站起来对医生怒目而视，“我只知道上帝用温热的血和神经创造了我，是的，就是这样！如果人体的组织活着，那它们就会对每一个刺激产生反应。而我就是这样！我用眼泪和哭喊回应痛苦，用愤怒回应卑鄙，用憎恶回应下流。我认为，这才能称作为生活。一个生命体越低下，也就越不敏感，对刺激的反应也就越微弱；而越高级，它对现实的回应就越敏感，越强烈。你怎么能不知道这件事呢？作为一个医生，却不知道这种小事！要对痛苦不屑一顾，永远满足，对任何事都不感到惊讶，一个人要到达这种状态，”Ivan Dmitritch指向那个满身脂肪的农民说道，“或者让自己被折磨到失去所有感觉——那就是说，不再活着。抱歉，我不是一个圣人或者哲学家，”Ivan Dmitritch恼怒地接着说道：“而且我对此一无所知。我不会讲道理。”

    “On the contrary, your reasoning is excellent."

    "The Stoics, whom you are parodying, were remarkable people, but their doctrine crystallized two thousand years ago and has not advanced, and will not advance, an inch forward, since it is not practical or living. It had a success only with the minority which spends its life in savouring all sorts of theories and ruminating over them; the majority did not understand it. A doctrine which advocates indifference to wealth and to the comforts of life, and a contempt for suffering and death, is quite unintelligible to the vast majority of men, since that majority has never known wealth or the comforts of life; and to despise suffering would mean to it despising life itself, since the whole existence of man is made up of the sensations of hunger, cold, injury, and a Hamlet-like dread of death. The whole of life lies in these sensations; one may be oppressed by it, one may hate it, but one cannot despise it. Yes, so, I repeat, the doctrine of the Stoics can never have a future; from the beginning of time up to to-day you see continually increasing the struggle, the sensibility to pain, the capacity of responding to stimulus.”
